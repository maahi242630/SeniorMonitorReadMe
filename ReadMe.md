# **A Non-Intrusive Approach to Monitoring Homebound Seniors Living Alone**


My project focuses on the problem of seniors living alone being unable to get up whether that be because they fell or because of sudden acute immobility due to a medical condition. In such situations, the senior may be unable to reach a phone to call a loved one for help, leaving them stranded and at risk of serious complications. 

The purpose of this project is to create a ** non-intrusive passive monitoring device ** to monitor a senior that lives alone. The device will ** track the motion of the senior and detect irregular activity patterns ** that may indicate immobility in real time to notify loved ones.

A major criteria for my proposed solution is that it must be non-intrusive. It must operate without requiring any work from the senior. Additionally, it must not invade the privacy of the senior.
